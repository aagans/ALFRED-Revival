# ALFRED-Revival
ALFRED Revival is an open-source project to rebuild the allele frequency database 
created and hosted by the Kidd Lab at Yale University. Due to a lack of ongoing 
support for the project, the original ALFRED has become difficult to use. 
ALFRED Revival is an interface utilizing modern technologies to interact 
with a newly-created ALFRED Revival database.
